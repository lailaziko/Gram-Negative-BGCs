# Biosynthetic gene cluster signature profiles of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria isolated from Egyptian clinical settings
This repository has the supplementary figures and tables for the research paper: "Biosynthetic gene cluster signature profiles of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria isolated from Egyptian clinical settings". 
The paper discusses key biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) detected computationally in three of ESKAPE pathogens isolated from different clinical specimens in Egypt. Most common BGCs detected in Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were siderophores, NRPS, and RiPP-like BGCs, respectively.
